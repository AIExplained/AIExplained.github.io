@article{Palmer1995,
    abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to finding solutions to the optimal communication spanning tree problem (OCSTP) using a genetic algorithm. The difficulties posed by this problem are reviewed and a genetic algorithm that consistently finds very good, if not optimal, solutions to it is presented. Finally, a comparison of the genetic algorithm's solutions to those produced by a good heuristic is given that demonstrates the genetic algorithm's ability to find solutions at least equivalent to, if not superior to, those found by the heuristic.

@article{Ronald1997,
    abstract = {Problems of encoding brittleness have been observed in the Genetic Algorithm (GA) literature, where slightly different problems require completely different genetic encodings for good solutions to be found. As research continues into GA encoding schemes the idea of encoding robustness becomes more important. A robust encoding is one which will be effective for a wide range of problem instances that it was designed for. A robust encoding will also be amenable to modification or extension to solve different problem types. This paper is a survey of some of the practical and theoretical considerations vital to the construction of a more robust encoding which will allow the GA to solve a broader range of problem types.},

@article{Rowe2010,
    abstract = {A genetic algorithm is invariant with respect to a set of representations if it runs the same no matter which of the representations is used. We formalize this concept mathematically, showing that the representations generate a group that acts upon the search space. Invariant genetic operators are those that commute with this group action. We then consider the problem of characterizing crossover and mutation operators that have such invariance properties. In the case where the corresponding group action acts transitively on the search space, we provide a complete characterization, including high-level representation-independent algorithms implementing these operators.},
